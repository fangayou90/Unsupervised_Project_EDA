    "### Assignment Questions and Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Which method did you like the most?**  \n",
    "I found PCA the most insightful. It effectively reduced the data to two principal components, preserving variance and making it easy to visualize clusters. This method provided clear patterns in vegetation indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Which method did you like the least?**  \n",
    "DBSCAN was the least effective. It struggled to identify meaningful clusters due to the dataset's structure and sensitivity to parameter settings. Fine-tuning `eps` and `min_samples` might improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How did you score these unsupervised models?**  \n",
    "- For KMeans, I used inertia and silhouette scores to evaluate cluster compactness and separation.  \n",
    "- For PCA, I relied on the explained variance ratio to assess how much information was retained in the principal components.  \n",
    "- For DBSCAN, I visually inspected the clusters and noise points, as scoring is less straightforward for density-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Did the output align with your geologic understanding?**  \n",
    "Partially. KMeans revealed groupings that could correspond to different land cover types. PCA helped clarify these patterns by reducing dimensionality. However, DBSCAN's results were harder to interpret due to parameter sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What did you want to learn more about?**  \n",
    "I would like to explore advanced parameter tuning for DBSCAN and compare its performance with other clustering methods like Gaussian Mixture Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Did you pre-process your data?**  \n",
    "Yes, I standardized all numerical features using `StandardScaler`. This ensured equal weighting across features and improved clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What was a decision you were most unsure about?**  \n",
    "I was unsure about selecting the number of clusters for KMeans and determining the `eps` value for DBSCAN. These decisions required balancing domain knowledge with trial and error.\n",
